## Novel microbial diversity and network analyses identify drivers of dynamics in plant microbiota 

### Abstract
Microbial communities are key components of most ecosystems, where interactions among microbes shape fundamental processes that support biodiversity and productivity. With the rapid development of sequencing technologies, an increasing number of microbiome datasets have been generated. However, standard analyses of these datasets often compare community composition between samples but overlook how microbes co-occur and potentially influence each other. To address this problem, we developed a generalizable computational framework that integrates compositional and co-occurrence network analyses, which we then applied to extensive microbial amplicon datasets. Here, we focus on the plant microbiota, which typically exhibits high diversity and remains challenging to characterize due to the large number of low-abundance taxa. We show that identifying a subset of representative microbial taxa captures the overall community structure while increasing the statistical power of downstream analyses. From these representative taxa, we inferred a large-scale co-occurrence network, from which microbes with co-varying abundances were clustered into units for diversity measurement. This approach not only reduces unexplained variance in diversity assessments but also captures the key microbe–microbe relationships that govern assembly patterns. Furthermore, we introduced a bootstrap- and permutation-based statistical approach to compare microbial networks from diverse conditions or environments. We demonstrate that our method robustly distinguishes meaningful differences and pinpoints the specific microbes and microbial features that drive those differences. These results highlight the importance of incorporating microbe-microbe interactions in microbiota studies, leading to more accurate and ecologically meaningful insights than traditional compositional comparisons alone. Our framework is made freely available as an R package, ‘mina’, enabling researchers to analyze microbial network architecture, identify condition-specific microbial interactions, and ultimately gain a deeper understanding of community ecology. With its broad applicability beyond plant systems, this package provides a valuable tool for leveraging microbiome data across disciplines, from agricultural settings to ecosystem resilience and human health.
